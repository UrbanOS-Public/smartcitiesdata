# Alchemist

Validates data by evaluating each message and verifying that it has the required fields as specified by the [`SmartCity.Dataset.Technical.schema`](https://github.com/smartcitiesdata/smart_city/blob/master/lib/smart_city/dataset/technical.ex) Valid messages will be produced to the next topic, and invalid or bad messages will be sent to a dead letter queue.

### Setup

- Run `mix deps.get` (in the smartcitiesdata directory) to install dependencies

### To run locally:

- To startup external dependancies in docker:
  ```bash
  `MIX_ENV=integration mix docker.start`
  ```
- To run a single instance with no data in it:
  ```bash
  `MIX_ENV=integration iex -S mix`
  ```
- To run a single instance with test data added to it:
  ```bash
  `MIX_ENV=integration iex -S mix test --no-start`
  ```
- To stop the docker:
  ```bash
  `MIX_ENV=integration mix docker.stop`
  ```
- To kill the docker:
  ```bash
  `MIX_ENV=integration mix docker.kill`
  ```

### To run the tests

- Run `mix test` to run the tests a single time
- Run `mix test.watch` to re-run the tests when a file changes
- Run `mix test.watch --stale` to only rerun the tests for modules that have changes
- Run `mix test.integration` to run the integration tests

### To run inside a container(from the smartcitiesdata folder):

- Build the docker with `./scripts/build.sh alchemist <your tag>`
